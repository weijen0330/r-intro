#### Getting to know your data #####

# View it
View(ed.data)

# Determine shape of the dataset
dim(ed.data)

# View / change column names
colnames(ed.data)
colnames(ed.data)[8] <- 'tuition.2012'

# Use the `nrow` function to determine how many institutions there are
nrow(ed.data)

# What was the most expensive school in 2014 (base R calculation)?
most.expensive <- ed.data[ed.data$tuition.2014 == max(ed.data$tuition.2014),] # using basic R selection

# What was the most expensive school in 2014 (using dplyr)?
most.expensive <- ed.data %>% 
      filter(tuition.2014 == max(tuition.2014)) %>%  
      select(Name.of.institution)

# What was the least expensive school in 2014?
least.expensive <- ed.data %>% filter(tuition.2014 == max(tuition.2014)) %>% 
  

#### What is the average annual tuition by sector in 2014? ####


# Show a `barplot of the cost by sector


#### How did the cost of UW rank against other Washington schools? ####


#### Which *sector* had the largest average change in tuition? ####


##### Which state has the most higher-ed institutions? #####
